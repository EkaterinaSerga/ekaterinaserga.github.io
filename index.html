    <h3>This is a story about my first Halloween in USA</h3>
    <p>It was October 31 and just a usual day for me. I would wake up in the morning, take shower and have my first cup of coffee. I'd then go out to the city to spend my day there while Gosha and Katya work. I love NYC. It's is so very interesting almost everywhere. I can get off at any subway stop and go out wondering through the streets, well, it is way better when the sun is out, rain is not really my type of thing.</p>
    <p>That's exactly what I did today and everything seemed normal until...</p>
    <p>You'll find out what happened next tomorrow. Until then my dears. Good night!</p>
